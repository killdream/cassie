Cassie
======

Cassie (short for lil' Cassandra) is a deliciously short [Future][]
library for JavaScript. It provides a simple `Promise` object that can
be used as the return value of any asynchronous call.

In short: **It helps you write readable code!**

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Cassie should run on any platform that supports ECMAScript v3. This
includes all the popular browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari)
and back-end stuff, like Narwhal and Node.js.

Where CommonJS modules are supported, they'll be used.
